Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

I am a French/American student at Code Institute, where I aspire to become a future junior web developer. This Portfolio was created to show my skills and tell a bit about me. My website is accessible in English, French and Spanish. This site also shows possible future projects that I would like to create.



UX:

I created this website as my resume to show to my future employers and colleagues. This portfolio showcases all the programming languages that I know so far and the languages that I speak. For example, I am an employer working for a startup, I want to take a look at potential candidates for junior web developers. A website would show me the candidate’s capabilities.   

My objective was to create an easy way to access each section or page through a navbar that moves when you scroll up or down. I choose to implement a unique and clear color layout in order to make it accessible for employers to read. The light gray color makes the site more modern.  

I decided to focus only on the essential information for the website itself and allow users to download a full version of my resume through a button if they want.

Also highlighted on the website are my contact details.

PS: for information I have designed 2 mockups available at the end of this document. 


 

Existing features:

- Navigation bar: allows users to navigate on the website by clicking on the links including choice of language.
- about me section: where I talk about my self.
- gallery: In which I showcase my future projects 
- Contact form: allows the users to contact me through the website by filling out the form.
- Download button allows users to download full CV in English, French and Spanish.


Features left to implement:

HTML

Deployment:
My website is being hosted on the Github website, where it is possible to update your code from cloud 9 directly to the Github website but I uploaded all my files directly from my computer to my repository on Github.
 
Testing:
My website was tested on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, FireFox) for desktop devices and also tested on smaller devices (Samsung Galaxy s8, Iphone SE, Wiko).
On a mobile device the menu becomes a burger menu. 

1)
The navbar was tested manually to show that it becomes a burger icon/dropdown menu for small devices. Also I tested to see if all the sections on the website are responsive for small devices.
I checked that the link on the upper right side allows the user to go to the top of page and checked that the menu hovers in red.

2)
I verified that the gallery appeases on samal devies and big. 

3)
I checked that the resume appears on small and big screens.

4)
If you don’t put all the required information on the contact form there will be an error message depending on the field left blank (name, email or message).
